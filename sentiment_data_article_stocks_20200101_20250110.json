However, with respect to long-term growth potential, the company is far from attractive. Google Search is engaged in a losing battle with competitors slowly but surely capturing market share. The Other Bets segment, comprised of smaller companies, that remain unprofitable, is in our opinion, a loss leader, designed to accumulate customer data, to further personalize GOOG's advertisements.  Google Search's desktop share has declined to 83.8% from 90.8%, and that related to Bing has expanded to 9.89% from 3.4%. Google Search will likely continue to dominate global search for a while due to strategies the firm has implemented to preserve a significant fraction of the search engine's market share.  The Other Bets segment of Alphabet is comprised of unprofitable companies which are highly unrelated to each other and to the corporation's core competency. The only similarity (between the new firms) is that they are developers of emerging technology. Google Cloud's potential for generating substantial long-term growth appears doubtful, as we have discussed above. We believe fundamentals do not support significant growth of Alphabet's business.  Over nine months ended September 2022: revenues were $207 billion, reflecting a growth of 13.4% compared to the same period in FY2021. Earnings per share was $3.50 versus $4.08 over nine-months ended September 2021.

ICE is also the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, along with a dozen other global financial exchanges. ICE maintains majority control of the outstanding shares, while allowing a minority amount of shares to float publicly. The remaining minority of shares available to public investors may prove to be a profitable trade.  Bakkt appears to be in the process of launching a succession of partnerships with major corporations currently. As these launches begin ramping revenue growth higher, they will likely become cumulative to deliver strong revenue numbers. Bakkt is a growth company within a growth industry, the gold standard for finding winning emerging growth stocks.  Bakkt is positioned at the intersection of blockchain, crypto, and Defi. These are all high-growth spaces. Much of Bakkt's pioneering tech infrastructure is now being built. The current hyper-adoption phase for blockchain, DeFi, and crypto technologies is a part of every new, significant technology wave. The inevitability of the crypto economy becoming ubiquitous is a foregone conclusion.  Bakkt is now launching crypto services for existing partners, with the likelihood of strong revenue growth ahead. The market is expecting confirmation of the Mastercard partnership's launch soon. Mastercard-Bakkt partnership is expected to provide a bullish catalyst when the launch is finally announced. Bakkt has relationships with most major U.S. banks already.  This trade was posted in my Seeking Alpha Marketplace service, Trader's Idea Flow by Bull & Bear Trading. I posted my first Trade Alert on my initial long position in Bakkt on 10/19/21 shortly after the SPAC IPO date. The long position was at $9 per share. On 10/25/22, Bakkt soared to over $55 per share, with a peak at about $60 in the pre-market of 10/26/21.  Bakkt has an existing relationship with Apple via Apple Pay. Bakkt CEO Gavin Michael has stated only that Bakkt is \"in advanced discussions\" with Apple to expand the relationship. The collaboration is very much in keeping with the strengths of the emergent crypto economy, as reported in the Visa whitepaper discussed earlier in this article. This alliance directly confirms the acceleration of Bakkt's international expansion plans.", "sentiment_spans": [{"sentiment": "positive", "idx": [32, 53]}, {"sentiment": "neutral", "idx": [77, 126]}, {"sentiment": "neutral", "idx": [184, 237]}, {"sentiment": "positive", "idx": [363, 398]}, {"sentiment": "positive", "idx": [438, 476]}, {"sentiment": "positive", "idx": [536, 566]}, {"sentiment": "neutral", "idx": [637, 637]}, {"sentiment": "neutral", "idx": [758, 806]}, {"sentiment": "positive", "idx": [825, 857]}, {"sentiment": "positive", "idx": [875, 905]}, {"sentiment": "positive", "idx": [930, 980]}, {"sentiment": "neutral", "idx": [1062, 1117]}, {"sentiment": "neutral", "idx": [1144, 1144]}, {"sentiment": "positive", "idx": [1270, 1340]}, {"sentiment": "positive", "idx": [1385, 1411]}, {"sentiment": "neutral", "idx": [1456, 1500]}, {"sentiment": "neutral", "idx": [1510, 1510]}, {"sentiment": "positive", "idx": [1619, 1646]}, {"sentiment": "neutral", "idx": [1766, 1767]}, {"sentiment": "positive", "idx": [1787, 1816]}, {"sentiment": "positive", "idx": [1880, 1919]}, {"sentiment": "positive", "idx": [1986, 2053]}, {"sentiment": "positive", "idx": [2072, 2146]}, {"sentiment": "neutral", "idx": [2240, 2265]}], "mentions": 6, "img_url": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/1127526785/image_1127526785.jpg?io=getty-c-w750", "title_sentiment": "neutral"}, {"timestamp": "2022-08-30T23:51:33", "asset_class": "stock", "location": "us", "original_url": "https://machash.com/mac-daily-news/336908/expect-apple-to-reveal-seriously-extreme-apple-watch-next/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter", "title": "Expect Apple to reveal a seriously extreme Apple Watch next week", "summary": "Apple News is your up to the minute Apple news source.

Tom Siebel is the founder, chairman and CEO of C3.ai, that's NYSE ticker symbol AI.The importance of being first to fully harness the technology growing so significantly.Condoleezza Rice recently spoke with our former Secretary of State about the AI race.  Tom Siebel: C3.ai is one of the largest AI applications deployed on Earth where we take all these signals, we run them through machine learning models.The B-1 bomber airframe has 42,000 sensors emitting telemetry at eight hertz cycles. That's eight times a second.Siebel: We're going back to some of the defense applications a little bit later on our conversation. The AI winter goes back to like 1950 when all these technologies were invented and really nothing happened for almost 75 years until we finally saw the elastic cloud become preeminent, big data, internet of things.Now, C3.ai is fulfilling its mission to establish a leadership position in that space.If we look at the AI market today, the value is perceived of in the silicon and the infrastructure. Tom Siebel founded C3.ai in 2009, about 16 years after established Siebel Systems.Siebel Systems was the leading CRM application of the day and in 1999 the fastest growing company in the US.The company has found itself in an enormous market tailwind where there is insatiable demand for these applications. Siebel Systems is the fastest growing enterprise application software company in history.S Siebel was acquired by my former colleague, Larry Ellison at Oracle in January 2006.Tom Siebel: We are right on plan, and the market has played out about as we expected.The company has given itself a couple of different names in the C3 space. C3 Energy rebranded as C3 Energy to address the market opportunity that was there at the time was almost exclusively utilities and oil and gas companies.The company applied predictive analytics at massive scale to those value chains in Europe and in North America.Tom Siebel gave a $50 million donation to establish the Siebel School of Computing and Data Science housed within the Thomas M. Siebel Center for Computer Science, which was dedicated back in 2004. The University of Illinois is merging data science, computer science, and engineering structurally.Tom Siebel and CEO of C3.ai, NYSE ticker symbol AI, give us a five star rating, if you will, and a review.Siebel: It's important to emphasize the overlap and collaboration between these two fields. The AI market is, I think, very confusing for business people, and it's confusing for investors.Tom Siebel: We're unique in the space that we are really the first native AI company.He says generative AI is going to fundamentally change the nature of the human-computer experience. C3.ai showed its 20% year-over-year revenue growth.Tom Siebel: It's going to have a very important effect on change management and making these technologies available.The idea that we have to have this expertise in data science is just not true, he says. In February, we received 10,500 inquiries, the CEO, CFO, the person in charge of supply chain and manufacturing, customer service, whatever it may be, at some of the world's leading companies.The interest in generative AI is unlike anything I've seen in my professional career, Tom Siebel says.  OpenAI CEO Sam Altman highlights potential risks associated with generative AI.Tom Siebel: It's a privilege to be at the table, and it's the beginning and end.The company's high levels of interest is growing, interest is expanding.
